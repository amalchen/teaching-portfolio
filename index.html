                            Before laying out the foundation of my teaching philosophy, I want to start by
                            emphasizing the following:

                            In other words, I believe my role as a professor, or more specifically, my
                            role as an education professor at a community college, is to help teach and
                            guide our students as they prepare to work with children. And given the
                            impact that adults have on the children around them, it is imperative that
                            newer generations of teachers and early care providers are as prepared as
                            possible. Failing to do so means that we, as education professors, have not
                            only failed our student(s), but all children under their care.

                            The simple answer goes something along the lines of:

                            While the above requirement may seem obvious, doing it effectively requires a
                            significant amount of time and practice. At this point, I want to focus on
                            the parallels between my role as a professor and my students’ eventual role
                            as educators. In both cases, a teacher is guiding a group of students as
                            they (hopefully) learn about specific topics. Furthermore, the
                            <strong class="astro-ldKR6c5M">questions I ask about myself when working with college
                            students</strong> are very similar to the <strong class="astro-ldKR6c5M">questions educators must
                            ask when working with children</strong>. Because of this, I consider my role
                            as professor as an opportunity to model good practices for my students --
                            that is, <strong class="astro-ldKR6c5M">teaching by example</strong>.

                            One of the most important concepts I try to model for my students focuses
                            heavily on the learning environment and what shapes it. Specifically, the way
                            a teacher behaves, and his/her appreciation (or lack) of professionalism, go
                            a long way in dictating whether or not the class will be a positive or
                            negative experience. For example, at the beginning of each course I do my
                            best to establish our classroom environment (either in-class or remote) as a
                            safe academic space. I make it clear that respecting one’s colleagues, and
                            their opinions, is crucial. Discussions and debates are allowed, provided
                            they remain civil and productive. And more importantly: it’s alright if we
                            disagree! It is my goal to show every class that a healthy learning
                            environment is fundamental to effective learning and paramount to the future
                            of education.

                            I also believe tools such as empathy, compassion, and deductive reasoning are
                            important skills for all educators. Modeling them however requires a
                            multifaceted approach, that starts with understanding the circumstances, and
                            reacting accordingly. To that end, I am a huge proponent of using Abraham
                            Maslow’s <strong class="astro-ldKR6c5M">Hierarchy</strong> (also called “Pyramid”) <strong class="astro-ldKR6c5M">of

                            Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs states that all humans share the same types of
                            needs, and that those needs can be divided into five distinct categories.
                            Traditionally depicted in the form of a pyramid (as shown below), his
                            hierarchy asserts that these needs can be used to explain an individual’s
                            motivation, with the more basic needs (located towards the bottom) taking
                            precedence over those above. A simple example: an individual who is very
                            hungry (physiological level) will focus his attention on finding a food
                            source before addressing other deficiencies.

                            Let’s now apply this to education. As we <strong class="astro-ldKR6c5M">guide</strong> students
                            through the material, it is likely that some of them will encounter problems
                            along the way. And what separates a good teacher from a great one, is how
                            they handle those, potentially difficult, situations. While the problems
                            affecting my students are different from those impacting 10 year olds, which
                            are different from those impacting 5 year olds, and so on, the general nature
                            of Maslow’s hierarchy makes it applicable to all age groups. Put simply,
                            understanding that there are many potential reasons why a student, of any
                            age, is having trouble, is the first step. The second, is helping if/when
                            possible and appropriate.
                        </p><p class="astro-ldKR6c5M">
                            For example, if a student is having issues at home where he/she doesn’t feel
                            safe, their ability to focus during class and retain information could
                            understandably suffer. And the longer this goes on, the further behind the
                            student gets, and the greater damage. Let’s consider a student attempting to,
                            and having trouble, solving a specific type of math problem. Given that math
                            is inherently incremental, where future lessons assume an understanding of
                            the current material, all it takes is one bad situation to permanently damage
                            that student’s appreciation for the subject. As educators, it is our
                            responsibility to recognize when these bad situations occur, and if possible,
                            help guide the student through them.

                            The last major point I want to make regarding the importance of Maslow’s
                            Hierarchy of Needs is that each educator should remain cognizant of their own
                            needs. If, for whatever reason, our needs are not met, it is important that
                            we do not take out our frustrations on, or in the presence of, our students.
                            This especially applies to those working with children, because while
                            children will be able to tell if you’re in a bad mood, they won’t necessarily
                            understand why. And should the child assume they are at fault, the positive
                            learning environment the child was accustomed to will no longer exist -- a
                            problem that could have easily been avoided.

                            Another important theory or concept that I frequently employ in my teaching is
                            known as constructivism. This approach claims that learners <strong class="astro-ldKR6c5M">construct
                            knowledge</strong> rather than passively take it in. In other words, students
                            learn by “doing,” where the students learn through experience. While the
                            traditional approach to teaching (where the teacher provides information to
                            the students) still has its place, I try my best to integrate interactive, or
                            inquiry-based assignments and tasks, both for homework and/or in class.

                            is known as the (revised) Bloom’s Taxonomy. Named after the work of Benjamin
                            Bloom, this system was meant to serve as a <em class="astro-ldKR6c5M"><strong class="astro-ldKR6c5M">framework for

                            technically defined as a continuum, it is often summarized/presented
                            according to the six main categories: remember, understand, apply, analyze,
                            evaluate, and create.

                            While Bloom’s Taxonomy isn’t always presented as a pyramid, I found the

                            Teaching, useful:

                            take time, patience, and creativity. And it is for that reason that I
                            frequently push my students while emphasizing the importance of
                            critical thinking. For example, I often use the progression outlined
                            by Bloom to lead in-class discussions, guiding my students through the

                            scaffolding. According to Vygotsky, we learn best when new material is in the
                            <strong class="astro-ldKR6c5M">Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)</strong>, which refers to a

                            now</strong>, and <strong class="astro-ldKR6c5M">ends with what we can do with help</strong>. To use
                            this theory, the educator should present tasks that aren’t easy, but aren’t
                            too challenging — that is, tasks that can be completed with help. Using
                            this technique facilitates the student’s growth, thereby allowing them to
                            steadily take on increasingly difficult tasks. To apply this concept, I split
                            my class into groups, and/or provide peer tutoring/mentoring.

                            aid in the teaching process, they aren’t the only theories out there, nor are
                            they absolute. For example, constructivism dictates that people learn by
                            constructing knowledge, and the only effective way to teach involves
                            interactive, engaging activities. For the most part, I believe this to be
                            true. However, I can’t deny that more traditional approaches to teaching and
                            learning are required, especially when the students are completely new to the
                            subject matter. In short, my job as an educator is not to strictly adhere to
                            any given methodology, but rather use them when they are appropriate. And
                            while it is usually possible to plan ahead, every educator must be willing to

                            It is no secret that the past decade has been rough for educators across the
                            entire academic spectrum. This is especially true for those working directly
                            with children, including teachers at all levels and childcare providers. 
                        </p><p class="astro-ldKR6c5M">
                            Let’s start with teachers. Over the past decade alone, teachers in the public
                            school system have had to deal with a wide variety of problems, some of which
                            impact them directly, and others that impact their students.
                        </p><p class="astro-ldKR6c5M">
                            For example, let’s consider the impact of new forms of technology and social
                            media. I’m sure most would agree that mobile devices have had a profound
                            impact on our education system. On the surface, it’s hard to deny the
                            potential benefits, such as enhancing the way students, teachers, and parents
                            communicate, as well as providing students with fast access to research and
                            other resources.

                            Despite these benefits however, this increased connectivity has, and is
                            having, negative effects on our children. While there are some obvious
                            drawbacks, such as the potential for distraction, recent studies have
                            demonstrated that constant access to the internet, specifically social media
                            platforms, has the potential to have a devastating impact on our children’s
                            mental health. For example, increases in cyber-bullying have occurred through
                            text messages and social media networks like Facebook. As a result, social
                            media apps, such as Instagram, have been found to be a major cause of
                            depression and anxiety. Based on

                            and preschools were forced to close their doors, in many cases permanently. As a result, 
                            even when the pandemic passes, many of those businesses will no longer exist.

                                The highly polarized political environment we find ourselves in will prevent

                            also shined a huge spotlight on the field and its role in society. As a

                                    and closed schools means many parents can’t go to work. While this
                                    is troubling for many, it has also forced our society to finally

                                    life. This is also evident in the increased focus on childcare

                            Another one of my responsibilities as professor is to help our students pick a
                            series of classes that will help them reach their goals. I usually meet and,
                            if I can, help between 30 and 40 students every semester. While the primary
                            task of an adviser is fairly simple to understand, the wide range of
                            backgrounds common to education students can very quickly complicate
                            everything.

                            Given the important role advisers play in the academic process at HACC
                            (often times being one of the first people to work with students), it is our
                            responsibility to do our best to make it better when opportunities arise.
                            Furthermore, before anyone can determine if my work as an adviser is what it
                            should be, we should first discuss the most important part of the process:
                            the students. If an adviser has a hard time understanding the needs and goals
                            of their students, that adviser's knowledge of the program, or school, will
                            quickly become irrelevant.

                            As an adviser for the education program, the individuals I help can be split
                            into a few groups based on two criteria: (a) their goals, and (b) their
                            current (academic) situation (mainly, their past courses). Let's discuss
                            their goals first:

                                suggested course progression outlined by their program.

                                they are done at HACC, the number of options here can make these
                                cases substantially more difficult. Put simply, not all colleges
                                accept the same courses for transfer. And while our program does
                                its best to coordinate with other popular schools' education
                                programs (such as Eastern University), these situations have to be

                                In this case, there is a good chance the program has been updated
                                and the courses on their transcript may no longer exist.

                            have had a few students return after 10+ years, hoping to finish their
                            degree. In some cases, I have even successfully reached out and convinced
                            prior students (who didn't complete the program) to return and give it
                            another chance.

                            This leads me to my last major point on advising: <strong class="astro-ldKR6c5M">serving as an

                            the students on a more personal level. And while it is disappointing when a
                            student fails to finish, having the opportunity to watch and guide our
                            students, and eventually see them out in the world, caring for and teaching
                            children, <em class="astro-ldKR6c5M"><strong class="astro-ldKR6c5M">makes it all worth it</strong></em>.

                            For the majority of my professional career as an educator I have taught,

                            This certification, offered by the 
                            <a href="https://www.cdacouncil.org/en/about/learn-about-the-cda/" target="_blank" class="astro-ldKR6c5M">Council for Professional Recognition</a>,
                            is based on a core set of standards that guide early childhood 
                            professionals as educators.

                            The course offered by HACC (under workforce development) meets one night
                            per week for 40 weeks, over approximately 9 months. At the completion of 
                            the course, these teachers earn the Child Development Associate Credential 
                            through the Council for Professional Recognition in Washington D.C. 
                            This credential is recognized throughout the United States to identify
                            educators that know how to nurture the emotional, physical, intellectual,
                            and social development of children.

                            My role in this process includes training and testing new educators. To
                            stay qualified to teach HACC's course, annual trainings are required.
                            I believe the CDA credential is one of the most important qualifications 
                            for those in early childhood development. And given that it is recognized
                            nationally, ensuring educators have access to training and testing is 
                            imperative. The CDA training course at HACC also helps the education program
                            as it is not uncommon for prospective students to start with with CDA training,
                            and then continue at HACC as part of the normal education program.
